# Multi Neuron Linear Regression Model - TensorFlow.js Machine Learning

## Description

This project is a demonstration of performing linear regression using a multi-layer neural network in TensorFlow.js. It shows how to construct a neural network with multiple neurons in TensorFlow.js that predicts the output based on the square of an input number. The network consists of an input layer with 25 neurons, a hidden layer with 5 neurons, and an output layer with a single neuron.

## Features

- Data normalization to improve training efficiency.
- A neural network model with multiple dense layers.
- Non-linear ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization.
- Learning rate adjustment after a set number of epochs.
- Real-time training progress logging in the console.
